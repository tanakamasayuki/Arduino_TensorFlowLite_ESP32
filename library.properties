sentence=Allows you to run machine learning models locally on your ESP32 device.
paragraph=This library runs TensorFlow machine learning models on microcontrollers, allowing you to build AI/ML applications powered by deep learning and neural networks. With the included examples, you can recognize speech, detect people using a camera, and recognise "magic wand" gestures using an accelerometer. The examples work best with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board, which has a microphone and accelerometer.
